Test does not have edge cases as there are no possible edge cases.
The only functionality of the "Add/Remove" button part of the page is adding/removing a checkbox.
When a button is pressed it disappears and the other one appears in its place.
The same is valid for the "Enable/Disaple" button part of the page.
There is no possibility to add text to the input field while it is disabled ("Enable" button is visible)
